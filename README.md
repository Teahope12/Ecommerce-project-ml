  baseURL: process.env.JINA_BASE_URL || "https://api.jina.ai/v1",
});

export async function embedTexts(texts) {
  const input = Array.isArray(texts) ? texts : [texts];
  const response = await client.embeddings.create({
    model: "jina-embeddings-v2-base-en",
    input,
  });
  return response.data.map((d) => d.embedding);
}
```
